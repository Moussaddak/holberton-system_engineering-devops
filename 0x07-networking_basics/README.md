# *Networking basics (PART 0)*

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.
It is organized from the lowest level to the highest level:
- The lowest level: layer 1 which is for transmission on physical layers with electrical impulse, light or radio signal
- The highest level: layer 7 which is for application specific communication like SNMP for emails, HTTP for your web browser, etc

#### In this project we will mainly focus on:

- The Transport layer and especially TCP/UDP
- On the Network layer with IP and ICMP

###### The image bellow describes more concretely how you can relate to every level.
